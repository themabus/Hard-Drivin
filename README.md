# Hard-Drivin
Just compiled x86 DOS Hard Drivin' with an external gfx lib<br>
since the original one was missing<br>
![hd](./hd.gif)<br>
* audio works
* interface works
* collisions work
* physics work
* cpu cars work
* replays work
* ghost car works
<br>
Notice a bit lacking hidden surface removal.<br>
<br>
Since Hard Drivin' II runs on the same engine,<br>
albeit with some fixes & adjustments,<br>
this also works with tracks from HD2 & editor<br>
after they are renamed to 'TRACK.DAT'
